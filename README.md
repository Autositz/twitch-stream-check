### Why Twitch Stream Check and not TwitchApp mobile notifications or eMail notifications?
The answer is pretty simple.
Not everyone has his eMail software open 24/7 and will therefor not receive notifications in time.
Not everyone wants to clutter his mobile device with the TwitchApp
Not everyone wants to check his mobile device for new emails everything a new one arrives just to get noticed if a stream is LIVE.
